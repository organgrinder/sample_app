STILL LEFT TO DO

- make numbers into objects with value, updated_this_round [and later -> possible_values]

- highlight last number solved

- add buttons to solve 5 numbers at once, solve entire puzzle

- implement more than 1 rule

- describe which rule is in effect for each solved number

- allow user to create own puzzle

- create random puzzle or pull on in from the web (currently it just solves 1 puzzle hard coded into the app)




DONE

- do layout with CSS rather than old school tags
