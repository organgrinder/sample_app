STILL LEFT TO DO

- implement more than 1 rule

- allow user to create own puzzle


DONE

- create random puzzle or pull on in from the web (currently it just solves 1 puzzle hard coded into the app)

- describe which rule is in effect for each solved number

- add buttons to solve 5 numbers at once, solve entire puzzle
	- this requires some reading about ordinary forms, rather than form_for's

- do layout with CSS rather than old school tags

- numbers are hashes so they have various characteristics that can change

- last number solved gets highlighted


QUESTIONS FOR SETH

- what's up with routing?  how to make the right request to go the right place - the right action in the right controller - I get sometimes how it works, but e.g. s/t I feel like I want to specify whether I'm doing INDEX, NEW, SHOW or EDIT instead of just GET
