STILL LEFT TO DO

- implement more than 1 rule

---------------------------------

BONUS FEATURES

- test for validity of a user-created puzzle

- say how many times a rule has been applied


DONE

- tell when puzzle can't be solved

- allow user to create own puzzle

- create random puzzle or pull on in from the web

- describe which rule is in effect for each solved number

- add buttons to solve 5 numbers at once, solve entire puzzle
	- this requires some reading about ordinary forms, rather than form_for's

- do layout with CSS rather than old school tags

- numbers are hashes so they have various characteristics that can change

- last number solved gets highlighted
